# PythonAutoClick

This is my attempt at a Python auto-clicker with a GUI.

--- in an alpha state ---

# Features
* A very minimalist GUI
* Start & stop keys (a-z)
* Interval between clicks


# Things to fix:  
* Implement a failsafe, or remove function of not necessary
* Make GUI appear in windows taskbar
* Add a key to exit program
* Backend does not exit with GUI if Daemon not started; likely thread issue
