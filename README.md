# PythonAutoClick

This is my attempt at an auto-clicking program written in Python, using Tkinter for the GUI. 

# Features
- A very minimalist GUI
- Start & stop keys (a-z)
- Interval between clicks
- Works on Runescape ;)

# Problems
- currently does not work on Linux :(

## v1.4
- Renamed modules and functions to be more "Pythonic"
- Removed quit function redundancy
- Minimize to tray when Start pressed
- Changed version names to make more sense

## To-Do
- [ ] fix broken on Linux
- [ ] add more keys and/or combinations of keys
