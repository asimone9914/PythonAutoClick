# PythonAutoClick

This is my attempt at a Python auto-clicker with a GUI.

# Features
* A very minimalist GUI
* Start & stop keys (a-z)
* Interval between clicks

## v1.4
* Renamed modules and functions to be more "Pythonic"
* Removed quit function redundancy
* Minimize to tray when Start pressed
* Changed versions to make more sense

## Things to fix:  
* Show an icon in Windows explorer
* Minimize to tray when Start button clicked
