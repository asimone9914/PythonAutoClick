# PythonAutoClick

This is my attempt at a Python auto-clicker with a GUI.

# v0.3
* Redesigned GUI in OOP style
* Change input values by pressing Start while clicking is stopped
* Escape key works in every fashion
_time to close dependent on Click Interval, will try to fix_
* Window 'X' button works in every fashion
* More exception handling
* updated icon

# Features
* A very minimalist GUI
* Start & stop keys (a-z)
* Interval between clicks


# Things to fix:  
* Show an icon in Windows explorer
* Minimize to tray when Start button clicked
